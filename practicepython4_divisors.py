Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

    numbers = list(range(2,(n+1)))
    for i in numbers:
